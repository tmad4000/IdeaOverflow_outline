Tell us what activities you are presently or hope to become involved with at MIT.
Breakdancing, cross-country ski, martial arts, rock climbing, surfing*, snowboarding, hiking, yoga, debate, acting, SIPB, high-tech entrepreneurship/Web development business, juggling/yoyoing, Rubik's cubing, blogging**, gaming, MIT hacking, playing RPG's, reading science fiction and fantasy and classic literature, cooking my way to the gustatory frontier of the universe, having late-night philosophical discussions, lucid dreaming, meeting incredible people at and around MIT, eating lunch each weekend with friends going to college elsewhere in Boston, living with my best friend of 12 years as a roommate, coding late on Saturday nights with my high school programming buddy and others I'm sure to meet, forging within the smithy of my soul the uncreated conscience of my species (sorry James Joyce), and most importantly, sleeping enough on top of this. Lucid dreaming hopefully will help with this latter goal.  For the rest I'll have to rely on Pareto's law (the idea that statistically speaking, 20% of your resources produced 80% of the yield in real economic systems).
*surfing is without a doubt my favorite activity on the list, though ironically, the only one that's actually impractical to do in Boston. There's nothing like it -- Dropping into a 7 foot barreling wave is like riding a standup, liquid roller coaster that I control (or if I fall it's like being a cockroach in a trash compactor).

The dormitory or FSILG you presently or hope to live with.
I'm temped in Burton Conner, but I'm going to check out East Campus during orientation and perhaps see if I can transfer (because it's that awesome). I love to cook, I love to work on intense projects (like installing an automatic party button in my room), I would be absolutely ecstatic to live in a dorm where I can paint murals on the walls and climb on the rock wall installed in the hallway while waiting for the scrumptious Italian delicacy I ordered by pressing the emergency pizza button to arrive.",0,NULL,,0,0,3,0,32

My guess is that if you log someoneâ€™s click patterns and show them how much time they are wasting, they will shape up rather fast! #self-quantification ~holden1@mit.edu ",0,NULL,,0,0,14,0,161

177,1369345677,Stanford,"Stanford: I would study something that covered applying business models using new technology to old industries (real estate) but mostly I would try to make as many friends as possible. The knowledge learned will go stale if not maintained, which makes the alum network the most valuable/durable asset you are buying by attending Stanford or Harvard etc. This is one of those quality over quantity things, I can attest to that being from the 2nd largest school in the nation. Building a technology requires a lot of human assets and investor confidence. Investors offer confidence to the Stanford/Harvard alum when evaluating technologies, the assumption is they must be worth a look (the school already pre-screened them). 

If I were an investor I would surely do the same. As the technology builder, I can\'t help but wonder if changing my school\'s name would have changed investor\'s reactions when I say \&quot;Here is an inevitable technology that will open a billion dollar plus market\&quot;. With UCF on my resume, all I get is a goofy facial expression that says \&quot;You must have over estimated, or have no idea what you are talking about\&quot;. However, in the past year I have watched $35m be invested into two companies, separately developing Part A &amp; Part B of my technology. It is only a matter of time before someone figures out that the real magic happens when the two parts are combined. Hindsight being 20/20 I wonder how my decision not to attend a well named Boston school has affected real world outcomes. I don\'t believe the education at UCF was inferior in any way, but I do wonder, \&quot;How much difference does the name make?\&quot; 

So go to Stanford if you can, and make a lot of friends",0,NULL,,0,0,19,0,
